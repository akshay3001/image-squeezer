# ImageSqueezer ‚ú®

ImageSqueezer is a fast, free, and private client-side image compressor. It allows you to shrink JPG and PNG images to common web-friendly sizes directly in your browser. Since no data is ever uploaded to a server, your images remain completely private.

This project is built with simplicity in mind, using only HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

This project follows the **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle and uses a minimal technology stack:

-   **HTML**: For the basic structure.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, utility-first styling (included via CDN).
-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For all the logic, including file handling and the compression algorithm.

No frameworks, no build steps, no complications.
